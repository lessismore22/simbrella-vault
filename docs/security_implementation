Security Implementation
1. Data Encryption

At Rest: Database column encryption for sensitive data
In Transit: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
Application Level: AES-256 encryption for PII

2. Access Control

JWT Tokens: Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
Refresh Tokens: Longer-lived tokens (7 days) for token renewal
Role-based Permissions: Granular permission system

3. API Security

Rate Limiting: Per-user and per-endpoint limits
Input Validation: Strict validation on all inputs
CORS Policy: Restrictive cross-origin policies
API Versioning: Version control for backward compatibility
